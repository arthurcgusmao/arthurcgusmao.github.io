  Although it may help, following your passion does not guarantee that you're going to be successful, neither that you're going to like the everyday and nitty-gritty of your job. Furthermore, the mentality that the classic "follow your passion" advice triggers can be disastrous, leading to demotivation and professional unhappiness.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="http://calnewport.com/books/so-good/" target="_blank"><cite>So Good They Can't Ignore You</cite></a> was written by Cal Newport, and is an investigation on the quest for finding a work you'll love.
</p>

<h2>Why following your passion does not necessarily make you love your job</h3>

<p>
  First, <strong>motivation isn't attached to the type of work in question</strong>, but to three traits that your professional environment can, or can't, offer. According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination_theory" target="_blank">self-determination theory</a>, they are:
</p>
<p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Autonomy</dt>
    <dd>The feeling that you have control and that your actions are important</dd>
    <dt>Competence</dt>
    <dd>The feeling that you are good at what you do</dd>
    <dt>Relatedness</dt>
    <dd>The experience of interacting, being connected to, and caring for others</dd>
  </dl>
</p>
<p>
  As we can see, they are not much related to <em>what</em> you do, but more to the <strong>freedom</strong>, <strong>acknowledgement</strong> (internal and external) and <strong>impact</strong> of your work.
</p>
<p>
  Second, <strong>loving your job takes time</strong>. For you to feel (and become) competent, you need time to develop your skills. For you to feel the impact and connection, you must have had many experiences to develop strong relationships with your coworkers and do things that really benefit others. Finally, to have autonomy, you need to be so good that you'll have a job (or start a business) that will give you more freedom.
</p>
<p>
  Do you see that there's a common element to conquering any of those three traits? Exactly, <strong>skill</strong>. Being good at what you do. At the book, Cal goes deeper into the subject, and also come with solutions for developing the skills, and once acquired, how to use them in the best manner to build work you love.
</p>

<h2>Why the mentality that "follow your passion" triggers is dangerous</h3>

<p>
  It may not sound, but the advice "follow your passion" can subtly make you develop limiting beliefs, causing demotivation and sabotaging your way to success and occupational happiness. For example:
</p>
<p>
  <em>"To be happy at work I need to find and follow my passion"</em>
  You may not have a passion. Or it's a passion you cannot match to a job. And maybe this is the case for the majority of people. Thus, people <strong>go through their lives thinking they are fated to have a job they don't like</strong>, and there's nothing much they can do, leading to chronic unhappiness.
</p>
<p>
  <em>"When I start working with what I love, tasks will become more pleasurable"</em>
  The person starts to live an illusion, <strong>leading to angst when her reality falls short of the dream</strong>. Furthermore, she starts to focus more on what she don't like in her current job and on what could be different in another place. As Newport would say:
</p>
<blockquote cite="http://calnewport.com/books/so-good/">The more we focused on loving what we do, the less we ended up loving it.</blockquote>
<p>
  <em>"I don't like my job, I may be doing the wrong thing. I have to find out my true passion"</em>
  Leading the person to job-hopping looking for an ideal job. Even worse, <strong>she feels trapped for being in the wrong job and cannot devote the necessary energy and time to become really good at what she do</strong> to finally have more benefits at work.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
  I would like to clarify that I'm not against doing what you love. Quite the opposite, I believe motivation can be the key to success. And the big insight is that <strong>"follow your passion" is an advice that brings no motivation to your everyday life</strong>, because you start to focus on what your work should be offering you, instead of focusing on the skills your should develop to offer the world.
</p>
<p>
  Your mentality in regard to work should be "I'm going to become so damn good that the world will give me great things in return", instead of waiting for these things come to you for no reason.
