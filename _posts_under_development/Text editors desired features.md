In this post I make a list of the functionalities that I discovered and find particularly useful to have in a text editor. Many of these functionalities are available in all major text editors such as Vim, Emacs, Atom, VS Code, Sublime, etc., so if you find them appealing there is probably an easy way to get them working for you.

### Expand region (shift-space)
### Open newline (above and below)
### Duplicate line
### Clear/Delete line (clears line first and then deletes it if there's only whitespace in it)
### Move lines (the ability to move several lines at once)
### Multiple cursors
### Join line (above and below)
### Copy region or line
### Comment/Uncomment region or line
### Fill/Unfill paragraph (or Rewrap in VSCode)
### Indent multiple lines (the ability to indent several lines at once)
### Indent guides (indent marks on the screen)
### Highlight word (all over the document)
### Clipboard history (store several copied text chunks)

### Minimap
### Command pallete w/ Fuzzy Find
### Bookmark (bookmark specific lines of code)
### Snippets
### IntelliSense (a fancy word for code autocompletion)
### Peek definition (jump to definitions of functions/classes)
### Debugger
### Version Control interface
### Project management and navigation

### Open directory of current file in file manager
### Open terminal in current file's path
### Uppcase/Downcase/Capitalize words in region
### Subword mode (consider camelCased as 2 words when navigating words)
### Recent files/projects list (to quickly access recently opened files and projects)
### Reopen closed files (control-shift T)
### Macros (redo last commands)
### Tabs (having tabs at the top of the screen)
### Undo tree (visualize and navigate through all you undo/redo commands)

Other configurations

### Disable blinking cursor
### Keymap for adding ; to the end of line
### Transpose words
### Smart parenthesis (the ability to make parenthesis or other pair chars jump across words)
