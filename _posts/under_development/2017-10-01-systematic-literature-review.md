This article is a (very) brief summary of the technical report "Guidelines for performing Systematic Literature Reviews in Software Engineering", by Keele University's staff. Its goal is to propose general, comprehensive guidelines for software engineering researchers to undertake systematic literature reviews. More details about each stage described here can be found in the original report.

## Systematic Literature Reviews

A systematic (literature) review is a form of identify, evaluate and interpret all available research relevant to a particular research question or phenomenon of interest. Studies that contribute to a systematic review are called *primary* studies, while the systematic review itself is considered a *secondary* study.

In general, you may want to perform a systematic review if you want to summarise existing knowledge, identify gaps in current research or provide a framework to position new research activities concerning a topic of interest.

The main reason behind systematizing a review is to make it thorough and fair.

## The Review Process

The technical report summarises a systematic review into three phases:

- Planning the review
    - Identification of the need for a review
    - Commissioning a review (if done on a commercial basis)
    - Specifying the research question(s)
    - Developing a review protocol
    - Evaluating the review protocol (depends on the adopted QA procedures)
- Conducting the review
    - Identification of research
    - Selection of primary studies
    - Study quality assessment
    - Data extraction and monitoring
    - Data synthesis
- Reporting the review
    - Specifying dissemination mechanisms
    - Formatting the main report
    - Evaluating the report (depends on the adopted QA procedures)

Keep in mind that the stages listed above may involve iteration and are not necessarily sequential.


## Planning

Prior to undertaking a review, researchers should ensure that it is necessary. They should identify and review any existing systematic review of the topic of interest against appropriate evaluation criteria, regarding how all stages of that review were performed.

If an organization is commissioning a review, a document specifying the work is required. The document can be used both to solicit tender from research groups and to serve as a steering tool for the advisory group.

The critical issue in any systematic review is to ask the right question.

To reduce the possibility of research bias, a review protocol must be done. It specifies the methods that will be used to undertake a specific systematic review. Without the protocol, it is possible that the selection or the analysis of studies may be driven by research expectations.
